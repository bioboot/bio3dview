Interactive biomolecular structure visualization of [bio3d](http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/) objects in R.  

## Installation

You can install the development version of bio3dview from [GitHub](https://github.com/bioboot/bio3dview) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bioboot/bio3dview")
```

Dependencies include the R CRAN packages [bio3d](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bio3d/index.html) and [NGLVieweR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NGLVieweR/), which can be installed from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("bio3d")
install.packages("NGLVieweR")
```


## Example 1

First let's load up the packages and generate a quick NGL (webGL based) structure overview of a bio3d pdb class object with a number of simple defaults. The returned NGLVieweR object can be further added to for custom interactive visualizations:

```{r example1, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(bio3dview)
library(bio3d)
library(NGLVieweR)

pdb <- read.pdb("5p21")
view.pdb(pdb) |>
  setSpin()
```

![**Figure 1**. Structure of HRas PDB code: 5p21. *Note that the image here is not interactive due to restrictions with GitHub GFM format.*](man/figures/fig1a.gif)

## Example 2.
Here we generate a quick interactive multi-structure ensemble view of a bio3d `pdbs` object:

```{r example2, eval=FALSE}
data(transducin)

view.pdbs(transducin$pdbs, colorScheme = "res") 
```

![**Figure 2.** All 53 PDB structures of Transducin colored by residue index](man/figures/fig2.png) 

## Example 3.
As a final example let's perform a quick Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) and view the predicted large scale motions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
m <- nma(adk)
view.nma(m, pdb=adk) |>
  setPlay()
```

## Going further

There are many, many more options for customized viewing options available. Further examples can be found on our [getting started article]() with full details documented within in the individual functions [help pages]().
